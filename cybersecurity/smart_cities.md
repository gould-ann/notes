# Smart Cities

#### Data for smart cities

- Caution of personal information that can be captured 
- Environmental data
- nonpersonal (vehicles... machines... infastructure)
- **personal data is extremely important in this context**
- ***self pondering... what about data processing***
- smart water metering in Iowa... How else could it be monetized... Do you have to take multiple showers? Maybe we could sell them products based off of what we use... Etc.

- coding is now becoming data based based off of the introduction to deep learning 
- default is collect and then figure out the ethics behind it later
- Does it cause people to act differently... Be aware of social engineering based off of the data (cost of liberty to automony)
- internet traffic routing potentially similar to what a smart city could be like 
- Potential agritech
- City might not be able to keep the data
- Data sovereignty issues... Potentially not stored in another country... etc. 
- There (probably... imo) should not be specific ownership of the data
- consent for visitors and cities in the ideal smart city 
- consent missing in some contexts... Very tricky (traffic survallience)
- ***Another self pondering... Potentially subsidize in exchange for data (already in effect) ***
- Important to "de-identify" the data (that makes sense)
- "code is law" creating an architecture that can be able to be upgradable and not obsolete
- Lots of work to be done on privacy law
- "when we are in public we have no expectations of privacy"
- constant survallience w warrants... What constitutes the use of each
- Smart City is a brand over an architecture 
- pocurement activism
