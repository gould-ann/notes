# counting and permutations

1) Number of hands = (52 2)

2) number of flushes (same suits) (4 1) (13 5)

3) drawing k cards from deck of 52, minimum value that you can always form a flush:

## Basics of Probability

**Probability** - Assume that some procedure occurs. The set of all outcomes is called the sample space. An event is a subset of the sample space. Assume that all outcomes are equally likely. The probability of an event A $\subseteq$ S is defined as P(A) = |A| / |S|

#### Four Step Method

- Define the sample space using a tree diagram 

- identify the event(s) of interest

- determine probabilities of individual outcomes

-compute event probabilites
